      <h2>Flights</h2>
      <p>Direct flights into Zaragoza (ZAZ) are limited. Ryanair flies to Zaragoza from London Stansted (STN) and from Charleroi (CRL), but services run only on certain days of the week. Zaragoza Airport has taxis available at all times; a taxi to the city centre costs around €27. There are also cheaper public bus options.</p>
      <p>Many more flight options are available to Madrid (MAD) and Barcelona (BCN). From either city, Zaragoza can be reached via high-speed AVE trains (fast and comfortable, but more expensive) or Alsa intercity buses (slower, but cheaper). Both arrive at Zaragoza-Delicias, the city’s main station.</p>
      <p>Renting a car in Madrid or Barcelona is also an option; driving to Zaragoza takes roughly 3–3.5 hours from either city.</p>
