      <h2>Flights</h2>
      <p>Direct flights into Zaragoza (ZAZ) are limited. Ryanair flies to Zaragoza from London Stansted (STN) and from Charleroi (CRL), but services run only on certain days of the week. Zaragoza Airport has taxis available at all times; a taxi to the city centre costs around €27. There are also cheaper public bus options.</p>
      <p>Many more flight options are available to Madrid (MAD) and Barcelona (BCN). From either city, Zaragoza can be reached via high-speed AVE trains (fast and comfortable, but more expensive) or Alsa intercity buses (slower, but cheaper). Both arrive at Zaragoza-Delicias, the city’s main station.</p>
      <p>Renting a car in Madrid or Barcelona is also an option; driving to Zaragoza takes roughly 3–3.5 hours from either city.</p>

      <h2>Getting Around Zaragoza</h2>
      <p>Zaragoza is a compact and very walkable city. For most visitors, there is no need to rent a car: many hotels, restaurants, and sights are within easy walking distance. For slightly longer journeys, taxis and city buses are plentiful, affordable, and easy to use. Taxis can be hailed on the street or found at taxi ranks.</p>
      <p>The wedding takes place during the Fiestas del Pilar, when the city is busier than usual and some streets may be closed or pedestrianised. Public transport and taxis continue to operate during the festivities, though journeys may occasionally take a little longer.</p>
      <p>Dedicated shuttle buses will be provided between Zaragoza and the wedding venue (located outside the city). Full details and schedules will be shared closer to the date.</p>
